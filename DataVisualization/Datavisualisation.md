## What is Data Visualization? ðŸ¤”
Data visualization is defined as a graphical representation that contains the information and the data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, maps..etc .Data visualization techniques provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
Some of the Data Visualization methods are:
- Line Plot
- Bar Plot
- Distribution Plot
- Joint Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Violin plot
- Count plot
- Pair Plot

## 1.Distribution Plot
` A Distplot or distribution plot, depicts the variation in the data distribution. Seaborn Distplot represents the overall distribution of continuous data variables. The below graph depicts the plotting of data for various variables in the dataset.`

## 2.Line Plot
` A Line Plot is the plotting of data and joining them with a line. We can also plot multiple line plots on a single graph which makes easy to compare two plots. The below 
graph depicts the Minimum Temperature at different Locations for two different line plots. `
